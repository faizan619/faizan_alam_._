                <p>I started started doing my web development course during my start of first year(FY) in year 2021-22 just as a extra skill rather than other college studies and completed it at the end my my first year. I know it tooks me 1 year to learn web development but still i am happy I atleast learn it. </p><br>
                <p><h1>Why did I started Web Development.</h1></p>
                <p>During My staring days of college as our 1st semester was completely online.It gives me efficient time to gather other skill too.I look for various skill  like video editing, designing, web development, andriod development.At the last I find my Interest in Web development and dedicatedly Try my best to complete it.</p><br>
                <p><h1>About myself.</h1>
                    There is nothing special to say about me self . A boy from Mira Road(Thane) keen to learn new things and dream to make their parents pround one day.
                </p><br>
                <p><h1>Sports.</h1>
                <i>Sports teaches you character,It teaches you to play by rules,It teaches you to know What it feels to win and to lose,It teaches you about life.</i> I like enjoy Playing games like Running, Relay, Volley ball, Bedminton,Ludo and many more.</p><br>
                <p><h1>Education.</h1>
                    I completed my schooling from Banegar school which is nearer to our Home  and after that I completed my 11th and 12th in that same school. Now I am graudating from Royal College(Mira Road).In 10Th I Got 77.20% and in 12th I able to scored 67.66%.
                </p><br>
                <p><h1>Interest</h1>During my free time i use to thnk about any creative ideas .Like Drawing or designing Or I talk with my Friends .Well I even like to make new Friends . <i>Aap bhi dost ban jao by following me in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/faizan_alam_._/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faizan-alam-4a7408230/">Linkedin</a></i></p><br>
                <p><h1>Failure.</h1>
                    You can't get success without failure.In my life also there are some point where I lack behind or won't able to stand upon my expectation.Like After Completing my 12th I start Preparing for <abbr title="National eligibility of Entrance Examination">NEET</abbr> but i won't able to clear that.IN my school time I was Very Weak in Marathi.Well today also I am weak In Marathi.and there are many other failure which helps me to understand ,to learn and to gain experience from them. 
                </p><br>
                <p><h1>Success</h1>
                    Everyone have different way to look at the succes But IN my opnion success and failure are the part of life .It doesn't mean that If you are successful than you don't need and struggle more in your life.At every point .Life take a test .if we pass the test we could be successful but what if we fail . will change nothing just learn what mistakes and make sure of not repeating the mistkes again.
                </p><br>
                <p><h1>At the End.</h1>
                    Death is the butter truth of life and it is  universal truth.but before leaving the World do something that is inspiring and an ideal for other.
